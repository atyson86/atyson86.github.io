# Title: Mouse-Drag Tapestry!

# Known Bugs: None

# Overview:
This casual generator allows anyone to create their very own tapestry on the home page of my website! Simply drag your mouse in the open white space and watch as it fills with explosions of color. This project is able to captivate and engage any user because it gives the user complete control. You can move the sliders on the bottom of the page to control the colors of the particles and the size of them as well. This sense of control gives you creative power to make something unique and brand new every time. And if you make a mistake, you can simply press the "x" button to erase the screen and start from scratch. The best part of this casual creator is it takes most of the hard work out of your hands. The wild and sporadic nature of the particles moving across the screen is guaranteed to give whatever you're trying to draw more flare and excitement without taking away from your design. This means that even the least artistic person can create something they would be proud to show off. 

# Personal Meaning:
This project was personally meaningful to me because I have always thought of myself as rather un-creative! This project, and the course as a whole, has truly demonstrated to me that this is not the case. I am capable of not only creating something creative, but creating something that makes other people feel creative as well. This project especially has instilled a lot of confidence in my ability to create things. It also pushed me to explore new ways of creating that I didn't even know existed. With this knowledge I will be able to go forward and explore ideas with confidence, because I know that if I dedicate my time and effort to it I will be able to figure it out. That is a feeling that I certainly did not have prior to this project and this course. 

# Personal Challenge:
This project was a personal challenge that has been taking place over the past few weeks. I was inspired by this course to create a website that I could use to show off some of the things that are most important to me. When I started, I had no experience in HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but I didn't let that stop me. I've been teaching myself and watching tutorials to build something from the ground up that I will be able to show off proudly. When I found out about this particular mission, I knew it would be the perfect complement to what I had already been working on - So I decided to simply incorporate it! And again, I found that this project was pushing me to explore elements of HTML and Javascript in ways that I had never even thought of before. While I know a lot of what I have created so far is even close to perfect, it has been a fun challenge that has pushed me so far creatively. Without this course, and the ways it has pushed me to grow as a programmer, I would never have even thought of starting a project like this. My next steps going forward will be to continue developing my website, so that I can purchase a domain name and proudly display it in a more accessible manner! 

# Sources of Inspiration:
p5.js Particle System: https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particle-system.html
- This was my initial inspiration when looking for something to create. It was pretty similar to the bubbles that we created in class, but I felt that it had a little bit more complexity with the whole velocity and lifespan component. This took some playing around with to figure out.

Raven Kwok "Noise Turbulence Doodles": https://openprocessing.org/sketch/143842
- This was my second source of inspiration. I was browsing through Openprocessing.org and this project caught my eye! It was so satisfying to doodle with and I knew I wanted to do something similar because it involved the use of the "particle system" that I found on p5.js. However, I found that most of what they were doing very complex and unnecessary for what I was trying to achieve. While it was visually appealing, it did not provide very much control to the user. I wanted something that was more focused on interactivity and control. This is why I implemented things such as the slider bars in my project so that the user could control things like color and size of the particles.
