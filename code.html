                    <h3>A Markov Distinction</h3>
                    <p>
                        How it Works: The program utilizes two different Markov Transition Matrices to probabilistically
                        select colors and shapes to display on a window of your preferred size. The transition matrices 
                        contain arbitrary probabilities that result in making colorful and unique pieces of art every time 
                        the program is run. The list of shapes include: rectangles, circles, ovals, triangles, and hexagons.
                        The list of colors include: Red, yellow, blue, green, cyan, pink, orange, purple, black, and white.

                        Personal Meaning: This system is personally meaningful to me because it represents my current feelings
                        upon entering this class. I know I have the basic skills I need to excel, but there is trepidation, fear,
                        and confusion all melded together in my mind as I begin the journey through this course. The artwork that
                        is created in this system is excellent at displaying these feelings because it is an abstract mess of
                        confusing shapes and colors that are never permenant. You can run the program countless times and each
                        time you will end up with a different result of mixed colors and shapes. The true beauty behind the system,
                        however, is the unpredictability. Sometimes the artwork created is beautiful and makes sense the way the
                        shapes and colors fit together. Other times, the artwork is bad and the shapes and colors do not seem to 
                        fit together well. I think the unbeautiful pieces are just as important as the beautiful ones because they 
                        represent mistakes that can be made along the way that still lend themselves to improved learning.

                    <h3>Chauvin Trial Poet</h3>
                    <p>This is a poetry generator that uses Tweets related to a specific query in order to create a text corpus. Below I will outline the general process:</p>

                        <p>
                            1) Use Twitter API to collect up to 100 tweets related to the Derek Chauvin Trial that is happening in MN.
                            Then strip the text and store it in a .txt file entitled "sample_text.txt".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2) Train a POS Tagger based on tagged sentences from the nltk.corpus.brown('news') corpus
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3) POS Tag all of the words in the generated sample_text.txt file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4) Select 2 short random lines from the nltk.corpus.gutenberg "whitman-leaves.txt" fileid. use the trained
                            tagger to tag these words as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5) Generate a POS dictionary that maps parts of speech to their corresponding words in the sample_text.txt file.
                            Then Generate a CFD dictionary that maps each word to the occurence of subsequent words from the sample_text.txt
                            file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6) Generate 50 poems and score them and continually update a "best" poem as it goes. poem generation method:
                            i) take tags from the Whitman lines. ii) for each line from Whitman... for each whitman tag... grab a random 
                            value from the pos dictionary with key = to whitman tag (random.choice(pos[whitman tag])) check to see if that
                            word is in the cfd... if it is then assign it's max value (most likely next word) to a variable name "next_word"
                            ii) append the random value to a list called "line_words" iv) keep looping until line is complete... each time
                            checking to see if you can add "next_word" instead of a random value This will potentially make the poem more
                            coherent v) join the list of words for each line... then join both lines together. Scoring methods: i) compare
                            the syllables in each word in the generated poem to the syllables of the whitman poem lines. each poem starts 
                            with a score of 100 (meaning the syllable count is exactly the same) and then any time there is a difference 
                            of either more or fewer syllables it is subtracted from that score of 100. ii) Count the occurences of alliteration 
                            in the poem. Any time there is an occurence of alliteration, +1 is added back to the overall score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7) The "best" poem, or the poem with the highest overall fitness is then saved in a .txt file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            8) User has option to listen to the most recently generated best poem or to select a poem from the /poem folder.
                        </p>

                        Personal Challenge: This assignment really made me get out of my comfort zone. Prior to working on this task I 
                        had extremely limited experience using API's and python libraries. By really diving into this project I learned 
                        how to use many different API's and libraries such as Twitter, nltk, and pronouncing. The toolsets that these 
                        provided really helped me to excel and create something that in my opinion has some actual artistic value. I 
                        spent a lot of time investigating the different tools I could utilize in these packages and just doing research 
                        in general. I feel as though this was really my first time integrating intensive research into my coding practices. 
                        Furthermore, I learned a lot about natural language processing and the many interesting things you can do with it. 
                        This is definitely a project I would love to revisit and continue to explore.
